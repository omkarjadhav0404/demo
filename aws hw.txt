Introduction
1. what is cloud computing ?
ans - cloud computing refers to the practice of using to the practice of using remote servers to store, manage, and process data .
      it allows you to acess ur file & application from anywhere with internet connection .
      its like having a virtual storage space and computing power in the "cloud"
2. Deployment modulein cloud ?
ans - In cloud computing, a deployment module refers to a package or unit of software that is deployed and run on cloud infrastructure.
      It can include applications, services, or components that are designed to work together in the cloud environment.
      It's a way to organize and manage software deployments in the cloud.
3. Service Module In Cloud ?
ans - cloud computing, a service module refers to a component or unit of functionality that is provided as a service in the cloud. 
      It can include services such as storage, computing power, networking, databases, and more. 
      These service modules are designed to be scalable, flexible, and accessible over the internet.
      They allow users to leverage cloud resources without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. 
      It's like having a menu of services that you can choose from in the cloud.
4. Architecture of cloud computing ?
ans - The architecture of cloud computing typically involves a combination of different components.
      At a high level, it includes the following Layer
      1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): This layer provides virtualized computing resources like virtual machines, storage, and networks.
         It gives you the flexibility to manage and control the underlying infrastructure. 
      2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): This layer provides a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications.
         It includes tools, frameworks, and runtime environments to simplify the application development process. 
      3. Software as a Service (SaaS): This layer offers ready-to-use software applications that are accessible over the internet.
         Examples include email services, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and collaboration tools.
5. AWS global infrastructure count ?
ans - AWS has a vast global infrastructure with data centers located in various regions around the world. 
      As of my last knowledge update, AWS operates in 25 geographic regions, including Pune, Maharashtra, India. 
      Each region consists of multiple availability zones, which are separate data centers within that region. 
      This extensive infrastructure allows AWS to provide reliable and scalable cloud services to users worldwide.
6. why do we use region ?
ans - We use regions in AWS to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and low latency for our applications and services. 
      By choosing a specific region, we can deploy our resources closer to our target audience or leverage specific regulatory requirements. 
      It also allows us to replicate data across multiple regions for disaster recovery purposes.
      Regions in AWS act as separate geographic areas with their own data centers, giving us the flexibility to optimize performance and meet our specific business needs.
7. what is service and why we use resources ?
ans - 1. In the context of cloud computing, a service refers to a specific functionality or capability that is provided by a cloud provider, such as AWS. 
      These services can include computing power, storage, networking, databases, machine learning, and more. 
      They are designed to be accessible over the internet and can be used to build, deploy, and manage applications and infrastructure in the cloud.
      2. On the other hand, resources in the context of AWS are the individual components or entities that you create and manage within the AWS environment. 
      These resources can include virtual machines (EC2 instances), storage buckets (S3 buckets), databases (RDS instances), and more.
      Each resource has its own characteristics, configurations, and settings that you can control and manage based on your requirements.
      3.So, in simple terms, services are the functionalities provided by AWS, while resources are the individual components or entities that you create and manage within those services.
      It's like using different tools (services) to create and manage various objects (resources) in the AWS cloud

2.application LB
3.Network LB
4.gateway LB

88.How does the load balancer work in the backend? Can you explain it ?
>>>when there is a sudden increase in traffic in one ec2-instance  the load balancer distribute thetraffic with another ec2-instances.
and when the traffic becomes less it will automatically deletes the excess instance.

89.Features of Load Balancers ?
>>>security , flexible performance , monitoring , scalibility  , optimize load balancing , low global pricing .

90.What is ASG ? & Its types ?
>>>Auto Scaling groups are collections of Amazon EC2 instances that enable automatic scaling.it is a collection of ec2 instance with similar characteristic .These features help you maintain the health and availability of your applications.
Types:1.reactive scaling 2.predictive scaling 3.schedule scaling 4.manual scaling 5.dynamic scaling 

91.What is a Health Check ?
