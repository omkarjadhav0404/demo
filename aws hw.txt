AWS Ec2
59.what is ec2 . wht do we use EC2 service in cloud computing?
>>>Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. 
It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

60.Features of Amazon EC2 ?
>>>Amazon EC2 provides the largest and deepest instance choice to match your workload's needs.
       You have complete control of your instances including root access 

61.What is Hypervisor ? and its types ?
>>>A hypervisor is a software that you can use to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine
    1.Type 1 hypervisors directly access underlying machine resources
    2.Type 2 hypervisors negotiate resource allocation with the operating system, which makes the process slower and less efficient.

62,Where we use hypervisor
>>>to create and run virtual machines 

63.Steps to create an EC2 instance.
>>>Step 1: Choose a name of your instance. ...
       Step 2: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) . ..
       Step 3: Choose an Instance Type. ...
       Step 4: Create a key pair. ...
       Step 5: Configure Security Group. ...
       Step 6: Add Storage. ...
       Step 7: Review and Launch.

66.What is the meaning of server hibernating mode ?
>>>when EC2 instance is connected with cloudwatch it will go in hybernating state when the alarm is triggered to maintain CPU usage.

67 . What is KMS ?
>>> it is a manage service which make it easy to create  cryptographic key.
In cryptography, a key is a string of characters used within an encryption algorithm for altering data so that it appears random.
